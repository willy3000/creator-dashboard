# AI Usage Log

Even if you did not use AI tools, write "None" below.

## Tools used
1. create.xyz
- An online AI tool that helps generate user interfaces for React applications.

2. ChatGPT

## What you used them for
1. create.xyz
- I used this tool to generate the tailwind styles used in the application. This allows me to style the app faster and focus mainly on the logic. As a result, development time is cut down by an large percentage.

2. ChatGpt
- I mostly used chatGPT for debugging and quickly creating small utilities like formatting date and file sizes.

## Prompt links or summaries (optional)
- I mostly use a bunch of mini prompts rather than just one or two large prompts.
Examples:
- create a simple dark theme login form with the following fields: Email, Password.
- create a modern dark theme asset card that displays an image, type of asset, size and date created

## What you changed manually / decisions you made
- Not much on the UI. I mostly just changed colors, tweaked button styles and a few ui inconsistencies.
Most changes were logic based. Adding loading states, toast notifiers, loading and empty  indicators, connecting to the backend, fetching data, filters, search, sort, global states(redux) e.t.c.
