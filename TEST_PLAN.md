# Test Plan (3–5 intentional tests)

List the tests you chose and explain what each proves and why you chose it.

1. API connection - Verifies that the frontend can communicate with the backend. I chose it because without the connection te entire app fails.

2. Asset creation - to ensure that the user can successfully add an asset. I chose it because the entire app depends on users being able to store their assets.

3. Input validations - ensures that users cannot input invalid data or leave fields blank. I chose this because some fields like email are key in the running of the app.
